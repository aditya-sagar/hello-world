Branching
1. Branching can be done to add new features bug fixes, which can then be merged with the master. 
As this doesn't affect the master, we can freely experiment until the change is ready.
2. Anything in the master is always deployable.
3. Keep the branch name descriptive of its purpose.

Commits
1. Any change (add, edit, delete) is commited so it reflects in the master/branch.
2. Every commit is recorded, so that we can go/rollback to any version.
3. Keep commit comments clear so that it's easy to decide the current version as changes are made.
These commits also provide feedback to others contributing to code.

Pull Request
1. These requests are used to discuss commits and finally merge to the requested branch.

Fork and Pull Model, Shared Repository Model

Discuss and review code
1. Before any code is merged to the required branch, code needs to be reviewed and discussed.
2. The pull request allows this and any addtional comments that yoy may get.
3. Pull request comments can embed images, emoji, pre-formatted text blocks to allow the needed clarifiaction.

Deploy
1. If everything's fine, then the branch can be deployed.
2. If changes cause some issue, we can rollback to the master.
